										<p>Name: Steven Saing<br /> Student Number: s3782159<br /> Email Address: <a href="mailto:s3782159@student.rmit.edu.au">s3782159@student.rmit.edu.au</a><br /> Education: Currently First year at RMIT University<br /> Hobby: Driving</p>

									<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></p>
									<p>The reason why I am interested in IT is mainly because of video games. In high school we were able to create a simple game using the software GameMaker, which I had found quite interesting. I chose to study at RMIT as I heard they were one of the best universities alongside with Swinburne for their Information Technology course by friends and families. During my studies, I expect to learn how to program and create simple websites.</p>

									<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ideal Job</strong></p>
									<p>Web developers are responsible for the coding, designing and modifications done to websites. They create websites that are aimed to be user-friendly with a good design and clear navigation. Web developing is appealing to me as I use the internet every day, using different websites that have their own unique design, some being good, and others not. Some of the skills required for a web developer includes communication, presentation, team-work, and the ability to identify the clients needs. Programming languages such as Javascript and HTML is required to build websites. I currently do not have the skills, qualifications or experience for this position, but will acquire it after finishing my Information Technology course at RMIT University.</p>
