										My Profile</h1>
									<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
										<p>Name: Steven Saing<br /> Student Number: s3782159<br /> Email Address: <a href="mailto:s3782159@student.rmit.edu.au">s3782159@student.rmit.edu.au</a><br /> Education: Currently First year at RMIT University<br /> Hobby: Driving</p>
									</header>

									<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></p>
									<p>The reason why I am interested in IT is mainly because of video games. In high school we were able to create a simple game using the software GameMaker, which I had found quite interesting. I chose to study at RMIT as I heard they were one of the best universities alongside with Swinburne for their Information Technology course by friends and families. During my studies, I expect to learn how to program and create simple websites.</p>

									<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ideal Job</strong></p>
									<p>Web developers are responsible for the coding, designing and modifications done to websites. They create websites that are aimed to be user-friendly with a good design and clear navigation. Web developing is appealing to me as I use the internet every day, using different websites that have their own unique design, some being good, and others not. Some of the skills required for a web developer includes communication, presentation, team-work, and the ability to identify the clients needs. Programming languages such as Javascript and HTML is required to build websites. I currently do not have the skills, qualifications or experience for this position, but will acquire it after finishing my Information Technology course at RMIT University.</p>

						<p>The results of these online tests don&rsquo;t mean anything to me as I don&rsquo;t believe that an online test with multiple options can really identify someone accurately. The online test is enough to identify a person to an extent, but everyone has different perspectives of the answers. For example, I can be more organised than my friend, but on the online test I can answer with &ldquo;Agree&rdquo;, whereas my friend would answer with &ldquo;Strongly agree&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think these results will affect my behaviour as a team. When forming a team, people could look at these results and decide whether they in their team or not.</p>

						<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Project Idea</strong></p>
						<p>A Project idea I have in mind is to create a simple mobile phone app. I am passionate about those simple games you find on the app store/google play store as they are fun to play and is very user friendly. I would like to create a simple mobile phone game in the future, similar to &lsquo;Flappy Bird&rsquo; which had millions of downloads in a short amount of time. With my project of a mobile phone game, I would avoid plagiarism of another game&rsquo;s graphics, which is what &lsquo;Flappy Bird&rsquo; did with Nintendo&rsquo;s Mario series.</p>
						<p>This project would be interesting because even if a game looks simple, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it was easy to make. The game &ldquo;Flappy Bird&rdquo; was apparently only created within a couple of a days, but the design was plagiarised from another game. The chances of new mobile games striking high is very slim and even &lsquo;Flappy Bird&rsquo; took 7 months to become popular and have millions of downloads. &lsquo;Flappy Bird&rsquo; made about $50,000 per day of advertising income which is a lot for a single developer. Although &lsquo;Flappy Bird&rsquo; made about $50,000 a day, that&rsquo;s not even much compared to a Supercells &lsquo;Clash of Clans&rsquo;, another mobile game that has had millions of downloads. Although both of these games were free, &lsquo;Clash of Clans&rsquo; had in game purchases and about 150 developers. Even after 7 years after it&rsquo;s release, the revenue made by this game daily still exceeds $1,000,000.</p>
						<p>I have many ideas for mobile phone games but would like to start with something very basic first for my first phone mobile phone game, which could be something like a puzzle game, word game or something educational for little kids. The game would be aimed to be very user friendly as there are many apps on the Store that have received lots of complaints for being difficult to use. The first idea I have in mind is a simple chat bot, as we are currently creating one in my programming class. We are currently creating a chat bot using Eclipse, which mainly uses the Java language. With a chat bot, I would have multiple of mock conversations with different people to prepare the bot for different responses. As the chatterbot we are making in class only contains words, I would like my chatterbot app to have a character design, a voice and some movement. The second idea I have in mind is a word search, but I doubt that it would be popular as there are many word search apps already on the Play/App store. Although there are many word search apps out there, I would like to create one that&rsquo;s for children, which could have words categorised into animals or numbers. The third idea I have in mind is a game similar to &lsquo;Super Mario Bro&rsquo;s, which is a 2d game, side-scrolling game. Although there was only simple movement in the game such as back, forward and jump, the game was commended for it&rsquo;s precise controls, where you could control how fast the character would run or how high it can jump. With my ideas, as a project, it would be more ideal for it to be made by scratch, even if it wouldn&rsquo;t be as good.</p>
						<p>Mobile phones and a desktop computer would be required to build a mobile phone game. The app could be made by scratch with knowledge on programming. There are also many apps out there that assist with app making and some even do the programming part for you. &nbsp;Some languages that&rsquo;ll be useful to learn would be Python, Javascript, Java, and C++.<br /> If the project is successful, it&rsquo;ll be on the posted on the Google Play Store or Apple&rsquo;s App Store. One of the drawbacks could be that if the project idea went really well, there would be a lot of clones stealing your ideas and potentially making a better phone game.<br /> </p>
